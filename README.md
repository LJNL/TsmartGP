The program to be analyzed should meet the requirement that it can be compiled by GNU Make.

Our tool can be started by running start.sh. Before running it, you should set the root directory of TsmartGP, the root directory of the analyzed program and specify a directory to store outputs. These paths should be absolute paths.

After that, run start.sh and the program will be analzyed. The program is preprocessed by builder first. Then analyzer analyzes it and gives the number of errors found in it. Finally, visualizer shows the details of all the errors in browser.

Real-world applications used in our experiment can be downloaded from github and a sample program is given in derectory "project/".
